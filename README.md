# Tree Disease Detection

This project aims to detect diseases in trees using machine learning models. It includes a web application where users can upload images of tree leaves, and the application will predict whether the tree is diseased or not.

## Features

- FastAPI backend for machine learning model inference
- Flask frontend for user interaction
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- HTML templates for user interface
- For onnx model, I found an issue to push here in the master branch, thus I shared with you google drive where you can find the VGG16.onnx model.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7elLjqR6fxlsPMeqDm0G175cKL5lq0K/view?usp=drive_link
